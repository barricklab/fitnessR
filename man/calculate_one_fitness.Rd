\item{transfer_dilution}{The daily dilution factor for all serial transfers between the final and initial cultures}

\item{num_transfers}{The total number of transfers in the competition}

\item{initial_dilution}{Dilution of culture plated/analyzed at the beginning of the competition}

\item{initial_volume}{Volume of culture plated/analyzed at the beginning of the competition}

\item{final_dilution}{Dilution of culture plated/analyzed at the end of the competition}

\item{final_volume}{Volume of culture plated/analyzed at the end of the competition}
}
\value{
Relative fitness of test competitor2 versus reference competitor1
}
\description{
Function for calculating the relative fitness for one replicate of a co-culture competition experiment. This
is the base function used by fitnessR() on each row of data.
}
\details{
Dilution factors can be provided as values > 1 or < 1. For example, you can input
either 1e-2 or 1e2 for a transfer dilution of 0.1 mL into 10 mL or either 1e-6 or 1e6 for
the final_dilution if you transferred 0.1 mL to 10 mL three times in making the test tube you plated from.
The output data frame will have all dilution factors converted to values > 1.

The total volumes of the final and initial cultures are assumed to be equal. If they are not, then you can adjust the
transfer_dilution accordingly.

This figure shows how each of the input parameters relate to an experimental design that uses plating and colony counting
determine the number of each competitor present before and after they are propagated in co-culture.
